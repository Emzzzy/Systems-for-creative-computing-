Further python 

Lists 

- You can access individual elements using an index variable 
e.g. - drummer = beatles [3]

- You may come across "tuples"
- they are in round blocks instead of square blocks - you cant extend or shorten them 

Dictionaries 

- You can also collect data into a dictionary 
Person = {
'name':{
'first': 'Emma'
'last': 'Thompson'
},
'job': 'teaching assistant'
}
- Similar to lists, instead of indexing by a number, its indexed by the key (on the left)
print(person['job'])

- dictionaries can be anything - other dictionaries, objects, anything




Shelves 

- the shelve library allows you to link a dictionary to an external disk file 
- this can give you a quick and easy mini-database which persists between runs of the program 

DISCLAIMER - 
- If you chose to create a shelf and store it on a local disk, you'll be fine. However, never open a third-party shelf - other code may execute without you knowing 



obejcts 

- an "object" is an abstract data structure intended to mimic the real world 
- everything in python is an object 
- you define a type of object by defining a class



Jupyter - How it works 

- it enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. 
- Jupyter Notebooks are an community for communicating and performing interactive computing. They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explantory text, mathmatics images and rich media representations of objects
